# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Bring back check_record(value, limit) and print_report(...) from Week 3
#    (copy them, or rewrite them - either is fine). check_record returns
#    difference, percent and status. print_report does all of the printing,
#    nothing outside it should contain a print() of its own. Give each a
#    one-line docstring.

# your function(s) go here

def check_record(value, limit, warning_at=90):
    """Work out the difference, percentage and status for one record."""
    difference = value - limit
    percent    = (value / limit) * 100
 
    if percent >= 100:
        status = "OVER LIMIT"
    elif percent >= warning_at:
        status = "WARNING"
    else:
        status = "OK"
 
    return difference, percent, status
 
 
def print_report(label, value, limit, difference, percent, status):
    """Print one bordered report. Nothing is worked out in here - only shown."""
    print()
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {label}")
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"  Value       : {value:>10.2f}")
    print(f"  Limit       : {limit:>10.2f}")
    print(f"  Difference  : {difference:>+10.2f}")
    print(f"  Of limit    : {percent:>9.1f} %")
    print(f"  Status      : {status:>10}")
    print("=" * 34)
    print()


# ====================================================================== STORE
# 2. Get your records into a list of dicts, each shaped like:
#        {"label": ..., "value": ..., "limit": ...}
#
#    Threshold : write the list directly in the code - at least 3 records.
#    Typical   : instead, write a function load_records(path) that reads
#                label,value,limit lines from a file and returns the list.
#                Make your own data file, one record per line.
#    Excellent : also write the results out to a new file (one line per
#                record: label, status), as well as printing them.

    """Read label,value,limit lines from a file and return a list of dicts."""

        for line in f:
            label, value, limit = line.strip().split(",")

                "label": label,

    return records

    records = load_records("records.txt")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("records.txt not found - starting with an empty list")
    records = []


# =============================================================== PROCESS + OUTPUT
# 3. Loop over records. For each one, call check_record and print_report.
#
#    Excellent : also keep a running count of how many were OVER LIMIT, and
#                print that once, after the loop ends.

# your loop goes here

                     difference, percent, status)
        results_file.write(f"{record['label']},{status}\n")
        if status == "OVER LIMIT":
            over_limit_count += 1
 
print(f"Checked {len(records)} records. {over_limit_count} were over limit.")

# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it and check every record's numbers are correct by hand
#    [ ] If you are loading from a file, check what happens when the file
#        does not exist - write the error down
#    [ ] Check every function still does one job
